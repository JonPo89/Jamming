An app that connects to the user's Spotify account, and can be used to create playlists.

## Description

This is a project that I took on to practise and showcase some skills in Redux, React and how to connect and access .json components.  It requires the user to sign in and accesses the Spotify Web API to create playlists that can be saved to the user's account.

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues.
